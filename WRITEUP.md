# Write-up Template

### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*I choose app service becuase, App Service allows me to focus on building the application and it handles the infrastructure. As this project application is lightweight and does not require high performance computing services.

App service is very simple to understand and easy to use.*
